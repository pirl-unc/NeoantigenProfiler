Immunogenic targets such are vital for a sustained immune response against a pathogen. For cancer, neoantigens can be targetted to sustain an immune reaction against a tumor. However, cancer immunotherapy has not yet realized its potential to treat the disease. One reason why this failure exists is because a single set of neoantigens used in a treatment may only target a subset of the tumor cells, while another neoantigenically distinct lineage, may cause the tumor to reoccur. This package uses single-cell Longread-RNAseq data and the FLAMES package to demulitplux and group like clusters of cells that share neoantigens.
