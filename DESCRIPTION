Package: NeoantigenProfiler
Title: Determines Cell Groupings of Neoantigens from Longread-RNAseq Data
Description: Immunogenic targets such are vital for a sustained immune response
	against a pathogen. For cancer, neoantigens can be targetted to sustain
	an immune reaction against a tumor. However, cancer immunotherapy has
	not yet realized its potential to treat the disease. One reason why this
	failure exists is because a single set of neoantigens used in a
	treatment may only target a subset of the tumor cells, while another
	neoantigenically distinct lineage, may cause the tumor to reoccur. This
	package uses single-cell Longread-RNAseq data and the FLAMES package
	to demulitplux and group like clusters of cells that share neoantigens.
